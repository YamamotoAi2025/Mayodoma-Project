# 🪵 Mayodoma Series  
**— Moving Sculptures Where the Heart Can Live —**

## 🎨 Overview

The “Mayodoma Series” is a one-of-a-kind mobility art project, handcrafted and designed entirely by a single artist — myself.

These vehicles are not “cars” in the traditional sense. They are **rolling expressions of philosophy, craftsmanship, and inner space**. Each unit is entirely unique in form and purpose, created not for mass production but as **living sculptures that carry my spirit, ideas, and lifestyle**.

## 🚗 Concept

### ● Mobility as a “Moving Home”

I believe the essence of mobility is **comfort and emotional safety**.  
Sleeping in a vehicle should not be a "feature" — it should be **a natural result of feeling truly at home inside**.

In the Mayodoma Series, I design and build vehicles that serve not only as transportation, but as **quiet, personal, meditative spaces** — **“homes that move.”**

### ● Artistic Vehicles, Not Just Machines

- Built entirely by hand, by one creator — from design to assembly to finish  
- Designed not to look like cars, but **to express personal vision and purpose**  
- Made with natural wood and metal, combining warmth and strength  
- Each piece is **a vehicle, a sculpture, and a space for creation and rest**

## 🧰 Technical Background

- Licensed automobile mechanic  
- Certified used car dealer (with a legal antique/trade license)  
- Completed bodywork and paint training (Japan Paint Foundation)  
- Extensive personal experience in rebuilding, customizing, and maintaining many vehicle types  
- All vehicles are maintained personally on private land, safely and legally stored

## 🌍 Production Site & Future

The current production site is located in **Shiga Prefecture, Japan**.  
This is a geographically significant area:  
- Inland basin, safe from ocean rise  
- Rich in natural freshwater from **Lake Biwa**, Japan's largest freshwater lake  
- Considered a valuable location in a warming global climate

While my base may change in the future, **my vehicles are my true home** — they go wherever I go.

## 🐾 Anecdote: The “Hearse” Confusion

One of my creations, the **MD-01**, has often been mistaken as a hearse for pets.  
It’s a minimalistic black design created during the COVID era — a “work-utility spiritual vehicle” meant for solitude, not sadness.

Interestingly, during Japan’s luxury boom around 1990, a Middle Eastern monarch famously requested a **shiny golden Japanese hearse** during his visit — because it was so unique and stunning.

I see **MD-01** as the opposite: quiet, thoughtful, wabi-sabi — yet still remarkable.  
This contrast shows how **my work may resonate differently and unexpectedly with people around the world**.

## ✍ Final Words

> I am not building cars.  
> I am building places where I can live, think, and move forward — at the same time.

The Mayodoma Series is a life’s work, in motion.  
One day, I hope to share these creations with people across the world — not only as vehicles,  
but as **philosophical tools of beauty and purpose


**.
